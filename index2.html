            <p>Mission: Impossible is a series of action spy thriller films based on the television series of the same name, produced by and starring Tom Cruise as Impossible Missions Force (IMF) agent Ethan Hunt.

As such, the series focuses on Hunt as the lead character as opposed to the ensemble cast structure of the television series, although some characters, such as Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) have recurring roles in the films.</p>
